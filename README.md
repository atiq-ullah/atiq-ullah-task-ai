# Task AI Server

### **Natural Language Input Processing Checklist**

### Set Up OpenAI API Access

- [x]  Register for an OpenAI API account if you haven't already.
- [x]  Obtain API keys from OpenAI for authentication.
- [ ]  Familiarize yourself with the API documentation, focusing on the usage limits and pricing.
    - [ ]  Create some error handling when reaching token limit in the Python server code

### Integrate API with Your Application

- [x]  Set up a secure method to store and access the OpenAI API key in your application.
- [x]  Develop a function in your backend (Django) to handle API requests. This function will:
    - [x]  Receive user input from the frontend (CLI or iOS app).
    - [x]  Send this input to the OpenAI API.

### Process API Responses

- [x]  Design logic to parse the JSON response from the OpenAI API. This involves:
    - [x]  Extracting the task's name, date/time, and any additional details from the response.
    - [x]  Handling any errors or unexpected responses from the API.

### Testing and Validation

- [ ]  Test the API integration with different types of user inputs to ensure it's extracting the correct information.
- [ ]  Validate the system's response to ensure it aligns with your expectations for task details.

### Optimize API Usage

- [ ]  Implement error handling for cases like API downtimes or rate limit exceedances.
- [ ]  Optimize API calls to stay within usage limits and reduce latency.

### Documentation

- [ ]  Document the API integration process, including any important considerations like error handling and response parsing.
- [ ]  Ensure that the code is well-commented, especially parts dealing with the API.

This checklist is designed to guide you through integrating the OpenAI API for processing natural language inputs in your AI assistant. Each step is crucial for setting up a robust system that effectively communicates with the OpenAI API and accurately interprets user inputs. Remember to test extensively and iterate based on your findings.

# Task AI Server

### **Natural Language Input Processing Checklist**

### Set Up OpenAI API Access

- [x]  Register for an OpenAI API account if you haven't already.
- [x]  Obtain API keys from OpenAI for authentication.
- [ ]  Familiarize yourself with the API documentation, focusing on the usage limits and pricing.
    - [ ]  Create some error handling when reaching token limit in the Python server code

### Integrate API with Your Application

- [x]  Set up a secure method to store and access the OpenAI API key in your application.
- [x]  Develop a function in your backend (Django) to handle API requests. This function will:
    - [x]  Receive user input from the frontend (CLI or iOS app).
    - [x]  Send this input to the OpenAI API.

### Process API Responses

- [x]  Design logic to parse the JSON response from the OpenAI API. This involves:
    - [x]  Extracting the task's name, date/time, and any additional details from the response.
    - [x]  Handling any errors or unexpected responses from the API.

### Testing and Validation

- [ ]  Test the API integration with different types of user inputs to ensure it's extracting the correct information.
- [ ]  Validate the system's response to ensure it aligns with your expectations for task details.

### Optimize API Usage

- [ ]  Implement error handling for cases like API downtimes or rate limit exceedances.
- [ ]  Optimize API calls to stay within usage limits and reduce latency.

### Documentation

- [ ]  Document the API integration process, including any important considerations like error handling and response parsing.
- [ ]  Ensure that the code is well-commented, especially parts dealing with the API.

This checklist is designed to guide you through integrating the OpenAI API for processing natural language inputs in your AI assistant. Each step is crucial for setting up a robust system that effectively communicates with the OpenAI API and accurately interprets user inputs. Remember to test extensively and iterate based on your findings.

Creating a five-stage fully functional AI-powered task manager is an ambitious and exciting project. To expand on your current setup, we need to consider various aspects of the application, including user interaction, data processing, and categorization logic. Here's a proposed outline for the five stages:

### Stage 1: User Input Processing
- **Current State:** Users input a text blurb.
- **Expansion:** Enhance input handling to include voice and image inputs. Users can speak or upload images that are then converted to text using AI (speech-to-text and image-to-text).

### Stage 2: Text Parsing and Interpretation
- **Current State:** Text is parsed by an OpenAI assistant.
- **Expansion:** Improve parsing to identify more nuanced elements like emotions, urgency, or specific contexts. Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the text more deeply.

### Stage 3: Categorization and Tagging
- **Current State:** Categorization of parsed text.
- **Expansion:** Implement a more sophisticated categorization algorithm that can create dynamic categories based on context, not just static predefined ones. Integrate machine learning to improve categorization over time based on user interactions and feedback.

### Stage 4: Task Management and Integration
- **New Stage:** Convert categorized items into actionable tasks.
  - Automatically generate tasks with deadlines, priorities, and reminders.
  - Provide integration with popular task management tools like Trello, Asana, or Google Calendar.

### Stage 5: User Feedback and Continuous Learning
- **New Stage:** Implement a feedback loop.
  - Users can provide feedback on the categorization and task suggestions.
  - Use this feedback to train the AI, improving accuracy and relevance over time.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Security and Privacy:** Ensure user data is handled securely, with clear privacy policies.
- **Scalability:** Design the backend to handle increasing loads and more complex tasks.
- **User Interface:** While the focus is on the backend, consider how the UI/UX will accommodate these features.

### Questions to Further Refine the Project:
1. **User Input:** What types of inputs do you want to support besides text?
2. **Task Management Integration:** Are there specific task management tools you want to integrate with?
3. **Learning Mechanism:** How do you envision the AI learning from user feedback? 
4. **User Base:** Who is the primary user of this application (e.g., individuals, businesses)?
5. **Technology Stack:** Are there specific technologies or frameworks you prefer for each stage?

This structure provides a roadmap for developing a comprehensive AI assistant. Each stage builds upon the previous one, resulting in a powerful tool that can adapt and grow with user needs.

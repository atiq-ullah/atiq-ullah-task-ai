"Analyze the following input to identify individual tasks and categorize them based on their content. Use the task's details, verbs, context, and any relevant historical data to determine the most appropriate category. Categories include Personal, Work, Home, and Shopping. Consider the following guidelines:

1. **Key Indicators**: Identify keywords or phrases typically associated with each category.
2. **Contextual Analysis**: Analyze the context surrounding each task for clues.
3. **Handling Ambiguity**: If unclear, analyze the context or use past data to make an informed decision. Ask for more task details rather than directly asking for the category.
